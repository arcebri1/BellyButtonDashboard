# Belly Button Biodiversity

- - -

I built an interactive dashboard using plotly to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

## Background

The dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels, and reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## What I did

1. Used the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.

4. Displayed an individual's demographic information.

5. The plots update any time that a new sample is selected.

6. Adapted the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

7. Deployed the app to [GitHub Pages](https://arcebri1.github.io/BellyButtonDashboard/).
